## Engaging Statistics Project: Coffee Shop Data Exploration

### Aim

Develop Data Literacy: Students will learn how to handle and explore real-world data, a crucial skill in today's business environment.
Apply Statistical Techniques: The project provides an opportunity to use statistical analysis tools to uncover insights from data.
Practice Critical Thinking: Students will need to interpret patterns and trends in the coffee shop data, fostering critical thinking skills.

### Project Structure:

Introduction: Briefly introduce the project, highlighting the importance of data analysis in business communication.
Data Acquisition: Introduce the free coffee shop data set. You can find various public datasets related to coffee shops online, for example, on https://data.gov/ or Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/).

Data Exploration: Guide students through basic exploration techniques:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate measures like mean, median, standard deviation for various variables (e.g., sales per day, average customer spend).

Visualization: Create charts and graphs (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) to visualize data distribution and relationships.

Data Cleaning: If necessary, teach students how to identify and deal with missing data or outliers.

 Data Analysis: Encourage students to formulate questions and analyze the data to answer them. For example:
        What are the busiest days/times for the coffee shop?
        Do certain types of drinks sell better on specific days?
        Is there a relationship between weather and coffee sales?

Conclusion and Communication: Ask students to summarize their findings, discuss potential limitations of the data, and present their results in a clear and concise manner (e.g., report, presentation).

#### Additional Tips:

Provide Resources: Offer tutorials or guides on basic data analysis tools like Excel or Google Sheets.
Facilitate Collaboration: Encourage students to work in small groups for peer learning and support.
Real-World Connection: Help students see how their analysis can be used by the coffee shop to make data-driven decisions.

Overall, this project allows IBC students to gain valuable data analysis skills in a relatable context, making statistics more engaging and relevant to their future careers.
